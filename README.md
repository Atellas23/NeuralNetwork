# `NeuralNetwork` C++ Library and Package.
**NeuralNetwork** is a library and package for the C++ language, aiming at providing a reliable and reusable method to create, train and persistently save Artificial Neural Network machine learning models. As of now, it supports creating and training one-dimensional regression Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

You can have a look at the code (it's not much, but it's honest work!) or you can go straight into the sauce and use the library and package. You can read about how to use them in the documentation inside the `doc` folder. There is a documentation file for the library and another one for the package. Both detail how to proceed with the installation.

Currently working on version 0.0.1.
